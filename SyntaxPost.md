#South American Fever Pitch

##A Heated Match for the Ages

###Pre-Game

The hour was at hand and not a sign of a breeze. Heat rose off the pitch and sat in the bowl of the _stadium_, contained by the humidity in the air. It was as if the neighboring __rain forest__ and rivers were rooting for some other sport that day.

> There was no way they should have played that game in the middle of the day.

If the underdogs were to win this game they would need to:

* Keep attacking
* Take a few risks
* Stay hydrated
