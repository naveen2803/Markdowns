# Fishing for Perfection

*Marty Willshire's* has been serving fresh fish since the early 1900's in this small east coast town. I'd imagine they will still be in business deep into the 2000's. The food and presentation there is fantastic! Plus the views from their outdoor dining patio are picturesque.

The atmosphere makes one feel like they just arrived at port. Skull caps and windbreakers hang from fish hooks on the walls.

The tables look like they drifted ashore during the last storm.

The agenda for this outing consisted of:

1. Drinks
2. Soup and Salad
3. Main Course
4. Dessert
5. Final Review

### Drinks

They have a full service bar that has everything from your run of the mill beer to liqueurs and mixed drinks, but these salty dogs are well known for their import of rums. It's as if they have their own staff of pirates smuggling the stuff up from the Caribbean.

### Soup and Salad

I had to try their clam chowder. It was okay. I guess I expected more from chowder in a Maine restaurant. My wife had a garden salad. Nothing too special, but the presentation was nice. The soup and salad were serviceable.

### Main Course

I am a huge, huge fan of fish tacos. The word on the streets of Georgetown is that Willshire's has the best. So I had to give them a try.

They offer:

- Smoked Salmon
- Cod
- Seared Ahi
- Mahi Mahi

I rolled with the seared ahi, three of them.

Again, presentation was amazing. Alas, the flavor of these puppies was just not there. I think they may have needed some sauce. Even paired with a beer I couldn't bring out any pop in flavor.

### Dessert

Usually I reserve my donut eating for Sunday mornings, but when in Rome! A family friend told us a secret:

> Ask about the donuts at dessert!

These things were top notch!

A pretty good cap to an all around good meal.

### Final Review

The results are in:
